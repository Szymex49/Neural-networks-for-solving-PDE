        "Partial differential equations (PDE) appear in numerous fields of science i.a. in mathematics, physics or chemistry. Their task is to describe change of some quantities by using derivatives of given function. Unfortunately, most of them do not have analytical solution. Thus, lots of numerical methods have been derived. One of them, perhaps less known, is solving PDEs with a help of neural networks. That is the main topic of our report.\n",

The second chapter describes partaial differential equations and model parameters chosen for the simulations. Chapters 4 and 5 contain method implementation in Python programming language and analysis of three of its properties: consistency, convergence and stability. After all of these parts some conclusions will be drawn.\n",
